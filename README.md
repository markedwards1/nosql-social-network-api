## No SQL Social Network API

## Description
This app uses Mongoose, and MongoDb to create a database of users, thoughts, reactions and friends. 

- Motivated to create a nosql database and to further my understanding of restful API's
- I built this project for learning and understanding of a nosql database
- This problem and solutions can be used in many applications. In particular managing a database where documents, and subdocuments need to be stored, associations can be created, and ready for a front end application. 
- During this project, I learned about endpoints, the initial set up of models that verify emails, using logic to count 'friend' sub documents. And more understanding of vanilla javascript.
